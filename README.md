# UCI Heart Attack Dataset

The Heart Attack UCI database originally contained 76 attributes and was created to detect the presence of heart disease in patients using ML algorithms. In the original database, the target features are integers valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. However, most experiments refer to using this dataset instead, containing only fourteen of the original attributes. Experiments with the UCI database have also concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4 as 1) from absence (value 0) of heart disease. 

In this notebook we follow the same approach, analysing the data as a binary classification problem.
